# About me
I'm a PhD student at [Analytical Computing (AC)](https://www.ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de/departments/ac/) department of the University of Stuttgart and [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI)](https://www.bosch-ai.com), under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Steffen Staab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QvpcUn8AAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. Dr. Evgeny Kharlamov. Meanwhile, I'm also an [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de) (International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems) scholar. I obtained my master's degree in computational statistics and machine learning (CSML) and a bachelor's honored degree in economics and statistics from University College London, with an outstanding academic performance award. My current research interest includes but is not limited to 
- Graph database and complex query answering
- Knowledge representation and reasoning
- Multi-modal knowledge graphs 
- Graph Neural Networks
